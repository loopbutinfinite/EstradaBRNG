## Random Name Generator Directory

## Description: Created a directory that utlizes JavaScript to tie data from a JSON file and display it to the DOM. The directory consists of the class and staff roster from CodeStack Season 8 and displays their first name, last name, CodeStack email, and their personal emails. The directory has a button that will display a random entry and log that entry to a previous entries list on button click.
